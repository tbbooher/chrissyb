      %h2 Why home visits?

      %p
        Sessions are held in the child's home for the same cost one would pay for
        an office visit to see a Physical Therapist at a clinic or hospital.
        In addition to being more convenient for busy families, we find that our
        clients achieve greater success when treated in their home, using familiar toys.
        Working in the home environment also helps parents and caregivers learn activities
        and exercises more easily to do with their child in between treatment sessions.

      %p
        We use Play based therapy sessions, which sets children up for success in an environment
        that is fun, nurturing and safe. Working together in your child's home environment also
        helps us to better understand your family's and your child's routines so that
        we may best coach you in activities and exercises that will help your child and meet your goals.

      %h2 How long is a treatment session?

      %p
        The length of a session is typically about an hour. The frequency of treatment is tailored
        to the needs of each child. Some children are seen once a week - others are seen every other
        two weeks. Again, this depends upon the needs of the child. In situations when children
        are seen post-surgically, sessions are scheduled more frequently.

      %h2 How involved are parents in the treatment sessions?

      %p
        Therapy is most successful for the child when parents are actively involved in the treatment sessions.
        Pediatric Physical Therapists are highly trained and skilled in working with infants, toddlers and children
        but we only see the child once a week and so much of our focus is on teaching the parents strategies
        and activities to work on with their child in between sessions, in the context of a child's
        daily routine and activities.
