      %h2 Why home visits?

      %p
        Sessions are held in the child's home for the same cost one would pay for an office visit to see a Physical Therapist at a clinic. In addition to being more convenient for busy families, we find that our clients achieve greater success when treated in their home, using familiar toys. Working in the home environment also helps parents and caregivers learn activities and exercises more easily to do with their child in between treatment sessions.

      %p
        We use Play based therapy sessions, which sets children up for success in an environment that is fun, nurturing and safe. Working together in your child's home environment also helps us to better understand your family's and your child's routines so that we may best coach you in activities and exercises that will help your child and meet your goals.

      %h2 How long is a treatment session?

      %p The length of a sessions are typically about an hour. The frequency of treatment is tailored to the needs of each child. Some children are seen once a week - others are seen every other two weeks. Again, this depends upon the needs of the child.

      %h2 How involved are parents in the treatment sessions?

      %p  Therapy is most successful for the child when parents are actively involved in the treatment sessions. Pediatric Physical Therapists are highly trained and skilled in working with infants, toddlers and children - but we only see the child once a week - and so much of our focus is on teaching the parents strategies and activities to work on with their child in between sessions, in the context of a child's daily routine and activities.
