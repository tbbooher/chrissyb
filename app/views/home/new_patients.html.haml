%h2 What happens during my initial visit?

%p
  After initial contact via phone or email with the parent, we will schedule a visit to complete your
  child's evaluation at your home. If there are reports available from the hospital, appointments with
  other therapists, doctors or other specialists your child has seen, we may request a review of that information.

%p You will need to obtain a prescription from your child's pediatrician prior to the first appointment and fax it to us at 888.750.4126 or have it available at the evaluation.

%p
  We ask that you complete a form to complete prior to the evaluation. We will email this to you after we schedule your child's evaluation.
  This will help provide some very helpful information and will allow us to maximize the use of our time with your child.

%p At the evaluation, we will conduct an assessment process that looks like play. Children often do not realize that they are being evaluated.
%p The first sessions(s) are designed to assess your child's level of functioning in both gross and fine motor skills, sensory processing, daily living and play skills, and to determine factors that may interfere with age appropriate skill acquisition. Generally the sessions are about 1 hour and combine structured and unstructured activities.

%p You are encouraged to be actively involved in your child's evaluation and subsequent sessions. You know your child best and issues of separation can be minimized.

%p Our goal is to help you and your child feel as comfortable and playful as possible. While we understand that the process can be stressful, we do our best to minimize stress and facilitate open communication.
