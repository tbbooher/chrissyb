  Sessions are held in the child's home. In addition to being more convenient for busy families, we
  find that our client achieve greater success when treated in their homes, as opposed to a clinic environment.
  Infants and children, are typically most comfortable in a familiar environment. Play based therapy sets
  children up for success in an environment that is fun, nurturing and safe. Working together in your child's
  home environment also helps us to better understand your family's and your child's routines so that we may
  best coach you in activities and exercises that will help your child and meet your goals.
  Length of Sessions are typically 50-60 minutes. The frequency of treatment is tailored to the needs of each child.
