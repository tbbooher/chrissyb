  %p We recommend Chrissy highly and without hesitation.  We met her in 2010, when our pediatrician told us that our 8-week old son needed to start physical therapy.  As first time parents, we were incredibly fearful.  Chrissy eased our fears and concerns by taking the time to educate us on our son’s condition, what to expect from her as his physical therapist, and what steps we would take together to help him get better.  In 2011, we learned that our second son required physical therapy, also starting at 8 weeks old.  Both of our sons have thrived under her high quality of care and over the past two and a half years, she has celebrated each of their milestones with us - both big and small.  She truly cares about our sons and we are so appreciative for everything that she has done for our family.

    Andrea is consistently professional, responsible and reliable.  She
    was always thinking about the next steps for our son, making sure that
    he was getting the therapy he needed while informing us of techniques
    to try with him.  She also advised us on assistive technology that he
    could potentially benefit from.  Being first time parents for a child
    with special needs, we didn’t know what to expect, what he would need
    or even where to start.  Without her extensive knowledge, we would
    have been lost and our son would not be doing as well as he is doing
    today.  Andrea worked with him to incorporate things that he enjoyed
    doing in the therapy sessions so that it wasn’t always work to him.
    She is a friendly, open person who addressed our concerns without
    disregard.  We believe that it was Andrea’s technical knowledge and
    her hands on experience that allowed our son to achieve his
    successes.

  %p Chrissy is truly great.  She put my mind at ease and answered all of my many questions during the initial meeting.  We have seen incredible progress in our son since we started working with Chrissy.  She makes sure we understand the next steps, goals, and what to work on from week to week.  She is great with our son and encourages him and us.  She is very responsive and genuinely cares about our son's progress.  She wrote a very comprehensive report for his pediatrician as well.
  %p We are very lucky to have found her!
